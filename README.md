👋 Hi, I'm @bs5q, a 15-year-old aspiring developer from the Netherlands!

👀 I'm passionate about web development, especially PHP, HTML5, and CSS. These technologies fascinate me as they bring creative ideas to life on the web.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deeper into web development, building on my skills in JavaScript, Golang, and a bit of Rust/C.

💻 I've been actively coding for about 1.5 years, and every day is a chance to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech world.

🎓 Excitingly, I'm gearing up to study IT support, aiming to strengthen my technical foundation and explore new IT horizons.

💞️ I'm open to collaboration and exchanging ideas with fellow developers. Whether it's a cool project, sharing knowledge, or brainstorming creative solutions, collaboration fuels innovation.

📫 Feel free to connect, share insights, or discuss potential collaborations! I'm eager to engage with the vibrant developer community.
